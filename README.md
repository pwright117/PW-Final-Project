# PW Final Project
This is a simple site that has elements to help a person start the day. The time, the weather, an inspiration quote of the day, and of course, puppies.

Known bugs:
The weather data isn't local, and I'm not sure how to fix the api to get local weather.

To do:
CSS to the page to add some calming things.
Change the clock to look nicer.
Add animations for everything.
Add more elements that can be helpful in the morning, like local brunch or coffee shop suggestions.

All of the code is up to date, enjoy!
