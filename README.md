# PW Final Project
This is a simple site that has elements to help a person start the day. The time, the weather, an inspiration quote of the day, and of course, puppies.

I'd like to spruce it up with some CSS, make the clock a bit prettier, center everything and make it larger/fade in. I'm not sure how to do any of this, but that is what I am going for.
